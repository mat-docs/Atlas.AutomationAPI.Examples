# McLaren Applied **ATLAS Automation API Sample Code**.

ATLAS Automation API allows an external application to control an instance of ATLAS that is currently running.

This solution contains the following samples: 
1. C# application. 
1. MATLAB script.

Both do the same - create a transient parameter, add Waveform Display and add vCar and the new parameter to it. To run start ATLAS, load a session in it and execute the sample application. 

ATLAS Automation API is available as a Nuget package to registered users from the **[McLaren Applied Nuget Repository](https://github.com/mat-docs/packages)**.
